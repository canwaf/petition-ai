# petition-ai
A repo to collaborate on a petition to the UK Government for debate in the House of Commons to enforce basic protections and opt-in when it comes to AI and ML training on User Generated Content.

Collaborate through issues or pull requests.

## Why now?

Want to get a petition in pretty quickly, but primiarly sparked by the recent (and silent) opt-in of LinkedIn for all non-EU users on training for their GenAI sludge products.
