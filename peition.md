We want the government to require all companies to request and receive a seperate, optional, non-transferrable, and explicit opt-in purpose-by-purpose to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning training data sets being created by said company.

This opt-in will protect UK citizens from overreach and privacy invasion by companies trying to further monetise their users' data. By requiring this opt-in, users can expect that their use of these large platforms is on more even terms than now. Additionally, the opt-in must be provided by the author, and cannot be on their behalf by any employer.
